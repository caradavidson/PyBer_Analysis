Overview of PyBer_Analysis:

PyBer is a ride sharing company that wanted their data analyzed to be able to improve their services and costs for neighborhoods. Their data was used by comparing weekly fares among each city. This analysis can then be used to make decisions to help improve PyBer. This data analysis was created using Python, Pands, and Matplotlib.

Res ults:
The first pieces of data used to help analyze PyBer's ride services were the percentage of total rides by city type, the percentage of total drivers by city type, and the percentage of total fares by city type. Each of these data percentages are shown by pie charts below.

The next piece of data used to analyze PyBer's services was a bubble chart. This bubble chart shows the relationship among the total number of rides per city and the average fare in dollar amounts in relation to urban cities, suburban cities, and rural cities. The circle size in this bubble chart correlates with the driver count per city.

When looking at this chart above, you can immediately notice the decrease in the average fare as the total number of rides per city increases. It shows that when the total number of ride increases or when the average price decreases, then the bubbles appear to get larger in size. This is interesting data to look at, especially because in rural areas the price varies from a low price point to a high price point, but their bubble size remains smaller compared to the other cities. When you see this data you are only analyzing the total number of rides per city, the average dares in dollars among the three city types. It would be helpful as a next step to add in more details that can futher explain this data.

Lastly, I analyzed the total fare by city type from January-April of 2019 in relation to the fare prices in dollars. I attached this line graph below.

Summary:
-When looking at the total fare by city type data analysis, urban cities have a disadvantage compared to other cities. Their wage prices are much more expensive, making PyBer an unappealing choice to take when needing a ride sharing service. This data should be looked at more closely so other factors can be determined to help figure out why these prices are so high. Other factors can be population, ride dristance, cell phone service, and other possible things that can alter their data. 
-Suburban ride sharing data appeared to be in the middle of rural and urban data in both fare prices and total number of rides. Things can be more appealing to riders in the suburban area to help improve ride sharing data.
-Urban areas, for the most part, have the highest numbers of drivers, riders, and the lowest amount of fare prices.
-In summary, when areas have a high demand of riders and a high amount of drivers, then the fare prices are lower for consumers. Although this data is clear in urban areas, this data ia not shown in suburban or rural areas. PyBer's next steps should include how to be appealing to all city types for both drivers and riders. When drivers want to make a fair wage and riders get to pay a fair price, then the riding engagement will most likely increase.
